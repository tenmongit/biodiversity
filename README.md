# Biodiversity Analysis in National Parks

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, focusing on various species observed in different national park locations. This analysis will cover the scoping, preparation, plotting, and explanation of findings based on the provided data.

## Research Questions

- What is the distribution of conservation statuses for species?

- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?

- the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

- Which animal is most prevalent, and what is their distribution among parks?

## Conclusions

The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.

This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
    - While mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles exhibited a statistically significant difference.
- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
    - the study found that bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.
